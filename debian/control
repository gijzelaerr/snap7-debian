Architecture: any
Depends: libsnap7-1 (= ${binary:Version}), ${misc:Depends}
Description: communication suite for interfacing with Siemens S7 PLCs
 The new CPUs 1200/1500 and SINAMICS Drives are also partially supported.
 Although it has been designed to overcome the limitations of OPC servers when
 transferring large amounts of high speed data in industrial facilities, it
 scales well down to small Linux based arm boards such as Raspberry PI,
 BeagleBone Black, pcDuino and CubieBoard.
 Three specialized components, Client, Server and Partner, allow you to
 definitively integrate your PC based systems into a PLC automation chain.
 Main features:
  * Native multi-architecture design (32/64 bit).
  * Platform independent, currently are supported Windows (from NT 4.0 up
    to Windows 8), Linux, BSD, Oracle Solaris 11.
  * Fully scalable, starting from blade servers down to Raspberry PI board.
  * No dependence on any third-party libraries, no installation needed, zero
    configuration.
  * Three Different native thread models for performance optimization: Win32
    threads/ Posix threads / Solaris 11 threads.
  * Two data transfer models: classic synchronous and asynchronous.
  * Two data flow models: polling and unsolicited (PLC transfers data when it
    wants to).
